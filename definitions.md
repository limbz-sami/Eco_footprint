# Definitions 
1. **Biocapacity**: A country's biocapacity, measured in global hectares, is its capacity to produce resources and to absorb generated waste materials.<br><br>

2. **Ecological Footprint**: Measures the ecological assets that a given country requires to produce the natural resources it consumes and absorb its waste, especially carbon emissions.<br><br>

3. **Biocapacity Deficit or Reserve**: A calculated measure equal to Biocapacity minus Ecological Footprint.<br> 
A **biocapacity deficit** (aka bio deficit) means the biocapacity is being overused, often when more waste is being created than can be absorbed and/or resources are being borrowed from an area with a biocapacity reserve.<br> 
A **biocapacity reserve** (aka bio reserve) means an area is producing or is rich in biological assets while producing little waste, even absorbing some waste. It has some biocapacity remaining.<br><br>

4. **Global Hectare**: Both ecological footprint and biocapacity are measured in global hectares. A global hectare is the annual amount of biological assets consumed by human use and human waste absorption per hectare of biologically productive land and fisheries. Global hectares are needed because different land types have different productivities. A typical land hectare is a unit of area equal to 10,000 square metres (107,639 sq ft) one square hectometre (100 metres squared or 328 ft squared).<br><br> 

5. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: The monetary value of all finished goods and services made within a country during a specific period.<br><br> 

6. **Human Development Index (HDI)**: A summary measure of key dimensions of human development: life expectancy and health, education, and income per capita as a standard of living. The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone.<br><br> 

7. **Earths Required**: Earths Required = Average Eco Footprint per Person / Global Average Biocapacity per Person. Each person's share of biocapacity is about 1.7 global hectares. In other words, if a country's ecological footprint is more than 1.7 gha, Earths Required would equal more than 1.0 and would be overusing its share of ecological resources.<br><br> 

8. **Developed, Developing or Less-Developed Countries**:<br>
A **developed country** has a relatively high level of economic growth and security. Standard criteria are per capita GDP or income per capita, level of industrialization, general standard of living including HDI, and amount of technological infrastructure. Although no strict level exists, some economists consider $12,000 to $15,000 per capita GDP to be sufficient for developed status; while others believe $25,000 to $30,000 per capita GDP is considered developed. Most developed countries have HDI figures above 0.8.<br>
A **developing or less-developed country (LDC)** is a nation with a lower living standard relative to other countries, underdeveloped industrial base, and low HDI. These countries' markets haven't yet reached saturation, but since the late 1990s many of them have had higher growth rates than already developed countries. Developing countries or LDCs are typically countries with an income per capita of less than $12,000.<br><br>
