# Project Description
Our team is looking at the overall impact of population and land use on the ecological footprint per region in a global data set.  We are hoping to find correlations from HDI and GDP to overall footprints as well.

# Research Questions
1. What types of land contribute more to ecological footprint? What is the relationship between type of land and total ecological footprint?
2. How much biocapacity is each region using? How does their ecological footprint compare to their biocapacity?
3. What is the relationship between population and ecological footprint?
4. What is the relationship between ecological footprint and Human Development Index (life expectancy, education, and per capita income, etc.)? 
5. Does a higher GDP have a correlation to a lower overall footprint?
6. How does the USA compare to the global average as far as biodeficit?

**Final Presentation Wed 10/23**

## Hypothesis:
If developed countries create a negative impact on biocapacity reserve,<br>
Then when HDI is 0.7 or higher, the footprint and/or bioreserve would decrease. (GDP?)

## Null: 
If level of development in a country has no effect on biocapacity reserve,<br>
Then the footprint and/or bioreserve would be random across countries.

## Task List:
- Alexis GDP v Bio Deficit/ Reserve
- (Define developed countries? HDI v GDP scatter plot?) DONE
- (Gmap’s Heat Layer?)
- (Matplotlib hover?)
- Hypothesis DONE
- Stats Test - ANOVA (HDI Groups) —> Independent TTest (between two HDI groups)
- Combine and clean code 
    - (chart styles, color?)
    - Save chart images
