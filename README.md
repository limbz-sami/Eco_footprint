# Project Description
Our team is looking at the overall impact of population and land use on the ecological footprint per region in a global data set.  We are hoping to find correlations from HDI and GDP to overall footprints as well.

# Research Questions
1. What types of land contribute more to ecological footprint? What is the relationship between type of land and total ecological footprint?
2. How much biocapacity is each region using? How does their ecological footprint compare to their biocapacity?
3. What is the relationship between population and ecological footprint?
4. What is the relationship between ecological footprint and Human Development Index (life expectancy, education, and per capita income, etc.)? 
5. Does a higher GDP have a correlation to a lower overall footprint?
6. How does the USA compare to the global average as far as biodeficit?

# Data Set
https://www.kaggle.com/footprintnetwork/ecological-footprint/
This data set represents only the year 2016.

# Hypothesis:
If developed countries create a negative impact on biocapacity reserve,<br>
Then when HDI is 0.7 or higher, the footprint and/or bioreserve would decrease. (GDP?)

# Null: 
If level of development in a country has no effect on biocapacity reserve,<br>
Then the footprint and/or bioreserve would be random across countries.

## Timeline
Initial analysis by Wed 10/16<br>
Merge ideas & Stats test Thu 10/17- Sat 10/19<br>
Practice and finalize presentation Sun 10/20 - Wed 10/23<br>

**Final Presentation Wed 10/23**

## Task List:
- Alexis GDP v Bio Deficit/ Reserve - DOne
- (Define developed countries? HDI v GDP scatter plot?) DONE
----------> Created Data Sets based on Specific Countries listed as Developed, Developing, UnDeveloped.  Check it out! [Alexis]
- (Gmap’s Heat Layer?)
- (Matplotlib hover?)
- Hypothesis DONE
- Stats Test - ANOVA (HDI Groups) —> Independent TTest (between two HDI groups)
- Combine and clean code 
    - Save chart images
    - filepath = os.path.join('Resources', 'countries.csv')
    - (chart styles, color?)
    
## Possible Presentation Narrative:
1. Population does not seem to relate to Footprint.
2. So we focused on HDI & GDP, two factors of a developed country. Both seem to effect Footprint (and Reserve?).<br> 
2b. How does development effect Footprint? GDP - Alexis; HDI - Samita
3. What is the footprint make-up of each country type? (Ellen)
5. Stats test / Test hypothesis
6. Observations Summary

## Factoids:
- The U.S. ranks 180 out of 188 countries in size of eco footprint. 
- There are 45 developed countries globally. All of them have Earths Required > 1.0 which means all of them are using more than their share of biocapacity. 
- There are 143 countries (76%) that are still considered “less-developed”.<br>
51 of them are “developing” and potentially will reach “developed” stage soon.
- There are 129 countries globally (69%) that have Earths Required > 1.0.
