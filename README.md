# Project Description
Our team is looking at the overall impact of population and land use on the ecological footprint per Region in a Global Data Set.  We are hoping to find correlations to HDI and GDP to overall footprints, as well.

# Research Questions
1. What types of land contribute more to ecological footprint? What is the relationship between type of land and total ecological footprint?
3. What is the relationship between population density and ecological footprint?
2. What is the relationship between ecological footprint and Human Development Index (life expectancy, education, and per capita income, etc.) by region? 
4. How much biocapacity is each region using? How does their ecological footprint compare to their biocapacity?
5. Does a Higher GDP have a correlation to a Lower Overall Footprint?
6. How does the USA compare to the Global Average as far as Biodeficit?

Inspiration from Kaggle:
Is your country running an ecological deficit, consuming more resources than it can produce per year? Which countries have the greatest ecological deficits or reserves? Do they consume less or produce more than the average country? When will Earth Overshoot Day, the day on the calendar when humanity has used one year of natural resources, occur in 2017?
